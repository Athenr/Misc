Constructive Criticism Notes
> just hopefully helpful code thingys
  - Swap screen OnEvents - Some are redundant functions, function that only calls another function not necessary.
  - No need to chain several breaks together, an empty return; will break the whole function. (It doesn't return anything.)
    + Will work in most languages that have a return!
